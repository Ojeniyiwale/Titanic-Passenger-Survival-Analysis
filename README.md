# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis Dashboard

> A data visualization and analysis project using Power BI to explore demographic and social patterns of survival aboard the Titanic.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project investigates the survival patterns among passengers aboard the Titanic using historical data from Kaggle. Through Power BI, we analyze how variables like **passenger class, gender, age, deck location**, and **fare** affected survival. The final output is an interactive dashboard designed to highlight patterns of inequality, access, and life-or-death outcomes.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Visualize survival distribution based on gender, class, age group, and deck location.
- Understand how social and spatial factors influenced passenger outcomes.
- Tell a data-driven story about survival inequity.
- Build an interactive dashboard using Power BI to share with both technical and non-technical audiences.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
  - Handled missing values (`Age`, `Cabin`)
  - Created new fields: `AgeGroup`, `FamilySize`, `Deck`
- Data Analysis & Visualization
  - Used bar charts, pie charts, cards, and slicers for exploration
- DAX Measures
  - `Survival Rate`, `Total Deaths`, `Total Survivors`
- Dashboard Design & UX
  - Organized layout with slicers and interactive filters
- Data Storytelling
  - Translated statistics into meaningful human-centered insights

---

## 📊 Key Features & Metrics

- **Total Passengers**: 3,000  
- **Total Survivors**: 1,000  
- **Total Deaths**: 2,000  
- **Survival Rate**: 33%

### Custom Columns
- `Age Group`: Child, Teen, Adult, Senior
- `Family Size`: Calculated as siblings/spouses + parents/children
- `Deck`: Extracted from Cabin value

## 🔍 Insights Gained

| Insight | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Survival was structured, not random** | Class and location shaped survival. |
| **Women were prioritized** | Gender roles visibly influenced survival outcomes. |
| **Seniors were most vulnerable** | Lower survival among older adults shows a need for inclusive safety plans. |
| **Deck level dictated access** | Proximity to exits and lifeboats was crucial. |
| **Higher fares brought better outcomes** | First-class passengers had more resources and quicker access to safety. |

---

## 💡 Recommendations

- Equalize safety access across all classes and decks.
- Tailor emergency protocols to support both elderly and economically disadvantaged individuals.
- Maintain ethical evacuation prioritization based on vulnerability (not just wealth or class).
- Ensure all cabin locations have equitable evacuation infrastructure.
